# Week-1-project

First project on Tech Ed course.
To try and copy a style of website using what we've learnt in the first week of the course.

Notes after finishing.
- I used shecodes, quackit, geeksforgeeks and W3school to find out informotion i needed.
- along side using the inspect tool on the spaceY website
- I couldn't get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page and on top of the background image, it always ended up with its own box below the image. I ended up fixing it
